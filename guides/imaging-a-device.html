                    One last change you should make is to change the boot priority of the device. To do this, go to the <b>Boot Configuration</b> tab in the left pane. Select the Seagate USB hard drive and move it to the top of the boot priorities.

                    <h3 class="bi bi-journal-bookmark-fill"> Note</h3>
                    <p>
                        if you do not see this option, you probably don't have the USB hard drive plugged in. Exit the BIOS and plug in the USB hard drive, then re-enter the BIOS so you can move this boot device to the top of the boot priorities.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <p>
                    Click <b>Apply changes</b> at the bottom of the screen and exit the BIOS. If you see that SmartDeploy has booted, move on to the next steps.

                    Once you SmartDeploy has loaded, there will be a popup titled <b>Unattended Mode</b> along with a counddown. Let this countdown finish. The image will install itself and Windows will eventually be loaded onto the device.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Complete the rest of the steps after Windows has been installed:
                </p>

                <p>
                        Log into Windows using the <b>Administrator</b> profile (<span data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title=".\administrator">username</span> // <span data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="DT@dmin18">password</span>).
                </p>

                    <p>
                        After the device has booted into Windows, the computer may restart itself to update its BIOS. This can happen at a completely random time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Do not turn the computer off during this process.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h3>Updating the Device</h3>
                <p>
                    To update the device, you will be using the Windows Settings program and Dell Command Update, both of wich are already installed on the computer.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Complete the following steps:
                </p>

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Go to <b><u>Windows Settings &rightarrow; Update & Securiy &rightarrow; Windows Update</u></b>. Click <b><u>Check for updates</u></b>

                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                If you are prompted to install Windows 11 upon checking for updates, click <b>Stay on Windows 10 for now</b>. At the time of writing, Windows 11 is currently not supported by many IT departments, nor is it compatible with our Fortinet VPN.
                            </li>

                            <li>
                                If you accidentally install Windows 11 onto the device, restart the imaging process from the beginning down to this step.
                            </li>

                            <li>
                                If you are prompted to restart the device to apply updates, it is most efficient to wait until all of the updates listed state <b>Pending restart</b>. After all of the updates state Pending restart, restart the device.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    
                    <li>
                        Repeat step 1 until there are no more updates listed in Windows Settings.
