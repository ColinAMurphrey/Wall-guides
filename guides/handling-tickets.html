            <h2>How to Handle Tickets</h2>
            <p>
                Here at the University of St. Thomas, we use the ticketing system, ServiceNow (SNOW). ServiceNow allows us to manage tickets, respond to users who have put in a ticket, as well as assigning tickets to whoever may be capable of assisting the user.
            </p>

            <h3>How to Log into ServiceNow</h3>
            <p>
                To begin using ServiceNow, click <a class="click-here" href="https://ellucian.service-now.com" target="_blank">here</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                When visiting the website, you will be prompted to log in with a username and password. However, the University of St. Thomas uses an SSO system. Click <b>Login with SSO</b>. For the User ID, enter <b data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="Password: DT@dmin">ustsnowstudents@stthom.edu</b>.
            </p>

            <!-- <img src="/assets/SNOW/login screen.png" class="img-fluid"> -->

            <div id="login" class="carousel slide" data-bs-ride="carousel">
                <div class="carousel-inner">
                    <div class="carousel-item active">
                        <img src="/assets/SNOW/login screen.png" class="img-fluid">
                    </div>
                    <div class="carousel-item">

                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>



            <p>
                You will then be prompted to enter an email again through Microsoft. Enter <b>ustsnowstudents@stthom.edu</b> again if necessary. You will be prompted to enter more information (image below). Click <b>Next</b>.
            </p>

            <div id="login2" class="carousel slid" data-bs-ride="carousel">

                </div>
            </div>

            <p>When you are prompted to setup Microsoft Authenticator, click <b>Skip setup</b>.</p>


            <h2>Using ServiceNow</h2>
            <p>When using ServiceNow, you should have a screen that looks like the following:</p>

            


            <img src="/assets/SNOW/tickets.png">
            
            
            

            <p>
                Of the sections on the left pane, the sections you will be using most of the time are <b>Case &mdash; My Cases</b>, <b>Case &mdash; Open</b>, and <b>Case &mdash; Unassigned</b>. Most of the time, you will be using the columns, <b>Number, Short description, Contact, State,</b> and <b>Update</b>, found in each section.
            </p>

            <p>
                The <p>My Cases</p> section is the section you will be workin in most of the time. You will notice that the <b>State</b> column will either be labelled as <b>On Hold, Open,</b> or <b>Solution Proposed</b>.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Open</b> &mdash; The ticket requires a response or change. Read the ticket to understand what must be done next to complete the ticket.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <b>On Hold</b> &mdash; The ticket is awaiting a status update, whether it is a response from the user or a change that is awaiting to happen.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <b>Solution Proposed</b> &mdash; The issue has either been resolved or the user has not responded within three attempts or seven days of attempting to contact the user.
                </li>
            </ul>



            <img src="/assets/SNOW/Open ticket.png">

            <p>
                Here, you will notice that the ticket's state (top-right of the image above) is labelled as <b>Open</b>. The user is asking when the computers will be updated.
            </p>

            <p>
                The <b>Additional comments</b> sections is the comment that the user will be able to see (it's basically the message you're sending to the user). The <b>Work notes</b> section is invisible to the customer. Use the <b>Work notes</b> section to let other technicians know what the status is or what should be done to complete the ticket.
            </p>

            <p>
                After typing out your message, be sure to change the <b>State</b> of the ticket to <b>On Hold</b>. You will then be required to state a reason, which will primarily either be <b>Awaiting Caller</b> or <b>Awaiting Change</b>. Given that the IT department needs to do a quick audit on the two computers that have been mentioned in this ticket, set the reason to <b>Awaiting Change</b>.
            </p>

            <img src="/assets/SNOW/On Hold Reason.png">

            <p>When updating a ticket, be sure to click the <b>Update</b> button at the top-right. <b>NEVER</b> click <b>Save</b>.</p>

            <img src="/assets/SNOW/UPDATE.png">

            <p>
                In the <b>Unassigned</b> section, you will be handling tickets similarly to in the <b>My Cases</b> tab. However, when responding to a ticket, be sure to assign the ticket to <b>UST Students</b>. If you must, elevate the ticket to a technician who will be able to assist the user.
            </p>

            <img src="/assets/SNOW/assign to.png">

            <p>
                If the ticket's issue has been resolved, or if the user has not repsonded within three attempts to respond to the user, mark the ticket as <b>Solution Proposed</b>. When marking a ticket as Solution Proposed, you will be required to enter some <b>Resolution Information</b>. Select the <b>Resolution code</b> as well as the <b>Resolution notes</b> textbox. Below is an example of how to fill out the <b>Resolution Information</b> section. After completing this section, click <b>Update</b> at the top-right of the ticket.
            </p>
